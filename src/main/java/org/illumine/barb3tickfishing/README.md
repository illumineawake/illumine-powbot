- Note: In-game setting must have Minimenu long-press time set to 100ms to let 3Tick Fishing work.

3Tick Frequency Modes
- Always 3Tick (VERY DANGEROUS!): stays in 3T continuously; no switching. NOT RECOMMENDED as it is a high ban-rate activity.
- Mostly 3Tick: prefers 3T with brief normal fishing windows
- Sometimes 3Tick: short 3T windows with longer normal fishing windows
- Never 3Tick: fishes normally only
